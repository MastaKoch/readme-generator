## Professional README generator
For this assignment, I had to create a readme generator using node js in an index.js file and a markdown js file.

The README generator creates a professional README based off of the responses the developer gives in the terminal of the index.js file.

Below is a screenshot of some of the prompt questions on the index.js file terminal:

After answering all of the questions, it creates a README.MD file. Below is a screenshot of the preview of the newly generated README.MD file:
